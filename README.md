# GrAPE

Language port for ZTStudio project to C# specification; original project is coded in VBasic.

GrAPE (Great APE) is in reference to the original APE software created by Blue Fang for Zoo Tycoon 1. It was a sprite extraction tool for the game that also provided an interface to generate configuration for new animals and other purchaseable game objects. GrAPE intends to do the same, with the initial goal to offer a stable environment not too dissimilar to the original tool but ported to a modern language and UI framework.

# Scope

Plans for the project will be split in stages. The following describes the longterm roadmap:

- Translate/refactor ZTStudio from current codebase to C# and away from VBasic
- Implement a familiar UI using Avalonia instead of WinForms for future portability to other OS
- Fix outstanding bugs persistent from original project
- Integrate generation of project templates for Zoo Tycoon 1 game sprites much like the original APE software
- Support the OpenZT project as an asset and mod creation tool for creators

# Credits

This project builds off of previous work done by other programmers formerly in the ZT modding community including

- Jay for some additional info on the ZT1 graphic format
- Jeffrey Bostoen for creating ZT Studio, documentation, figuring out how the background frame and MM shadow format works
