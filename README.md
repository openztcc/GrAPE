# GrAPE

Language port for ZTStudio project to C# specification; original project is coded in VBasic.

# Scope

Plans for the project will be split in stages. The following describes the longterm roadmap:

- Translate/refactor ZTStudio from current codebase to C# and away from VBasic
- Implement a familiar UI using Avalonia instead of WinForms for future portability to other OS
- Integrate automatic project templates for Zoo Tycoon 1 game sprites much like the original APE software
- Support the OpenZT project as an asset creation tool for modders

# Credits

This project builds off of previous work done by other programmers formerly in the ZT modding community including 

- MadScientist for figuring out most of the common ZT1 graphic format
- Jay for some additional info on the ZT1 graphic format
- Jeffrey Bostoen for creating ZT Studio, documentation, figuring out how the background frame and MM shadow format works
- Vondell for providing demo/test graphics to original ZTSTudio project
- HENDRIX for some contributions to the source code to original ZTStudio project
